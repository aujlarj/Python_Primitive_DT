# Python_Primitive_DT
Primitive data types in Python refer to the most basic data types available in the language, which serve as the building blocks for constructing more complex data structures. 

## 4 main type of Primitive Data Types
1. Integers (int)
2. Floating-Point (float):
3. Strings (str)
4. Boolean (bool)

There is 'None' type as well representing the absence of a value or a null value.

These primitive data types are <b> immutable </b>, meaning once a value is assigned to an instance of the type, it cannot be changed.
